## Overview

LuaCov is a simple coverage analyzer for [Lua](http://www.lua.org) scripts. When a Lua script is run with the `luacov` module loaded, it generates a stats file with the number of executions of each line of the script and its loaded modules. The `luacov` command-line script then processes this file generating a report file which allows one to visualize which code paths were not traversed, which is useful for verifying the effectiveness of a test suite.

LuaCov is free software and, like Lua, is released under the [MIT License](http://www.lua.org/license.html).

## Download and Installation

LuaCov can be downloaded from its [LuaForge page](http://luaforge.net/projects/luacov/files).

It can also be installed using Luarocks:

    luarocks install luacov

LuaCov is written in pure Lua and has no external dependencies.

## Instructions

Using LuaCov consists of two steps: running your script to collect coverage data, and then running `luacov` on the collected data to generate a report (see _configuration_ below for other options).

To collect coverage data, your script needs to load the `luacov` Lua module. This can be done from the command-line, without modifying your script, like this:

    lua -lluacov test.lua

Alternatively, you can add `require("luacov")` to the first line of your script.

Once the script is run, a file called `luacov.stats.out` is generated. If the file already exists, statistics are _added_ to it. This is useful, for example, for making a series of runs with different input parameters in
a test suite. To start the accounting from scratch, just delete the stats file.

To generate a report, just run the `luacov` command-line script. It expects to find a file named `luacov.stats.out` in the current directory, and outputs a file named `luacov.report.out`. The script take the following parameters;

    luacov [-c=configfile] [filename [ filename[ ...]]]

For the `-c` option see below at _configuration_. The filenames (actually patterns) indicate the files to include in the report, specifying them here equals to adding them to the `include` list in the configuration file.

This is an example output of the report file:

    ============================================================
    ../test.lua
    ============================================================

            -- Which branch will run?
    1       if 10 > 100 then
    0          print("I don't think this line will execute.")
    0       else
    1          print("Hello, LuaCov!")
    1       end

Note that to generate this report, `luacov` reads the source files. Therefore, it expects to find them in the same location they were when the `luacov` module ran (the stats file stores the filenames, but not the sources themselves).

LuaCov saves its stats upon normal program termination. If your program is a daemon -- in other words, if it does not terminate normally -- you can use the `luacov.tick` module, which periodically saves the stats file. For example, to run (on Unix systems) LuaCov on [Xavante](http://www.keplerproject.org/xavante), just modify the first line of `xavante_start.lua` so it reads:

    #!/usr/bin/env lua -lluacov.tick


## Configuration

LuaCov includes several configuration options, which have their defaults stored in `/luacov/defaults.lua`. These are the global defaults. To create project specific defaults, copy the file and store it as `.luacov` in the project directory from where `luacov` is being run.

Options include changing filenames, automatic report generation upon completion and removal of the stats after generating the report.

LuaCov was designed and implemented by Hisham Muhammad as a tool for testing [Luarocks](http://luarocks.luaforge.net).
